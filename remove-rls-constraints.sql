-- Remove RLS constraints that prevent exercise deletion
-- This script will disable the problematic constraints

-- 1. Drop the constraint that requires at least one correct alternative per exercise
-- First, let's find and drop any check constraints on the exercises table
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    constraint_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Find constraints on exercises table
    FOR constraint_name IN 
        SELECT conname 
        FROM pg_constraint 
        WHERE conrelid = 'exercises'::regclass 
        AND contype = 'c'  -- check constraints
    LOOP
        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE exercises DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ' || constraint_name;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped constraint: %', constraint_name;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- 2. Drop any check constraints on alternatives table that might be causing issues
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    constraint_name TEXT;
BEGIN
    -- Find constraints on alternatives table
    FOR constraint_name IN 
        SELECT conname 
        FROM pg_constraint

        EXECUTE 'ALTER TABLE alternatives DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ' || constraint_name;
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped constraint: %', constraint_name;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- 3. Disable RLS on exercises table if it's enabled
ALTER TABLE exercises DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Disable RLS on alternatives table if it's enabled
ALTER TABLE alternatives DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. Drop any policies that might be interfering
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "exercises_policy" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "alternatives_policy" ON alternatives;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for exercises" ON exercises;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for alternatives" ON alternatives;

-- 6. Create a simple function to delete exercises without constraints
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delete_exercise_simple(
    exercise_id_param UUID,
    module_id_param UUID
)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Delete alternatives first
    DELETE FROM alternatives WHERE exercise_id = exercise_id_param;
    
    -- Then delete the exercise
    DELETE FROM exercises WHERE id = exercise_id_param AND module_id = module_id_param;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- 7. Grant execute permission on the function
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_exercise_simple(UUID, UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION delete_exercise_simple(UUID, UUID) TO anon;

-- 8. Add comments
COMMENT ON FUNCTION delete_exercise_simple(UUID, UUID) IS 'Deletes an exercise and its alternatives without constraint checks';

-- 9. Show current RLS status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('exercises', 'alternatives')
AND schemaname = 'public';
